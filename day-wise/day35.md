 are related by inheritance.

 Polymorphism is useful in java because it allows us to re-use attributes and methods of an existing class in a derived class

 ### Runtime Polymorphism

 It is also known as dynamic polymorphism and it is implemented through method overriding


 ### Compile-time Ploymorphism

 Also known as static polymorphism is  done by method-overloading
